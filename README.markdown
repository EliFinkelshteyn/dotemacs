dotemacs: My personal Emacs configuration
=========================================

How do I install it?
--------------------

Clone the project from git://github.com/dholm/dotemacs.git and symbolicallylink <i>.emacs</i> and <i>.emacs.d</i> into your <i>$HOME</i>. From the repository path initialize the submodules by executing <i>git submodule init</i> followed by <i>git submodule update</i> which will pull in all the submodules.

After performing the aforementioned steps you should now be able to launch Emacs and enjoy all the packaged configuration goodies.
